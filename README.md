# Implementation of a machine learning algorithm on an esp32 using the BME688

In this repository you will find the different files used for implementing a machine learning algorithm made by bosch using the adafruit/Bosch BME688 sensor:
More explanations on how to use the files here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vs_w_9rIWZzF76EOs_i_H5kShtdvldttZDzdsQ-DgS0/edit?usp=sharing

**None of the files here have been developped by me, I only modified them.** 

### This repository is structured as follow:

**src**: contains all sources files of the different steps of the project

**lib**: contains the zip files of the libraries I used at the time I made this project.
